## Acoustic-to-seismic ground coupling: coupling efficiencyand inferring near-surface properties

A fraction of the acoustic wave energy (from the atmosphere) may couple into the ground,and it can thus be recorded as ground motion using seismometers. We have investigatedthis coupling, with two questions in mind, a) how strong it is for small explosive sourcesand offsets up to a few tens of meters, and b) what we can learn about the shallow subsur-face from this coupling. 25 firecracker explosions and 5 rocket explosions were analyzedusing co-located seismic and infrasound sensors; we find that around 2% of the acousticenergy is admitted into the ground (converted to seismic energy).
