## Acoustic-to-seismic ground coupling: coupling efficiencyand inferring near-surface properties

This is the code to reproduce "Acoustic-to-seismic ground coupling: coupling efficiency and inferring near-surface properties" Novoselov et al. 2020 paper in Geophysical Journal International.

A fraction of the acoustic wave energy (from the atmosphere) may couple into the ground, and it can thus be recorded as ground motion using seismometers. We have investigated this coupling, with two questions in mind, a) how strong it is for small explosive sources and offsets up to a few tens of meters, and b) what we can learn about the shallow subsurface from this coupling. 25 firecracker explosions and 5 rocket explosions were analyzed using co-located seismic and infrasound sensors; we find that around 2% of the acousticenergy is admitted into the ground (converted to seismic energy).

We provide an interactive Jupyter Notebook for this paper, in order to uphold to the highest accademic standards and make our research truly reproducable.
