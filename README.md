## From G. Bokelmann:

_Some Notes before diving into the data analysis for the Ground Coupling Experiment (and some Questions):_

### Ways of displaying the data:**
- [x] Record sections (r-t-plots with distance r from source), including IS (infrasound) channels with a different color, for each source type (explosion, rocket, hammer blow, stepping)
- [x] Spectrograms of collocated vertical S (seismic) and IS channels, to distinguish the different wave types, for each source type
- [x] Can one distinguish the different sources types visually? - **Yes**
- [ ] Can one distinguish P, S, and other phases? How does the infrasound appear on the S-traces?
- [ ] Could one identify the IS from S-traces alone?
- [x] Can one see the Doppler effect in the rocket spectrograms?
- [ ] Can one see infrasound-generated Rayleigh waves (for tomographically imaging near-surface vs-velocity from an infrasound source)?

### Meteorological conditions:
- [x] Show P and T as a function of time, as well as velocity and direction of the wind.
- [x] Can one see the decrease of wind speed approaching the surface? - **No**
- [ ] What is going on with the meteo-data? Can we trust them?
